Tkinter is a great library for UI development in python. Specially the canvas widget of tkinter lets you make any custom widgets for your application. If you are planning to create an application or want to implement a UI for your scripts, then tkinter is still one of the best options out there. The tkinter community is also growing and people are making new widgets for the library.
Moreover, after the arrival of [**`customtkinter`**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), it is super easy to create a modern UI with tkinter.

**Tkinter-Toolkit is a small application that helps you find new tkinter widget libraries.** There are lots of awesome libraries and widgets listed in the app.
