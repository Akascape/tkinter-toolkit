Tkinter is a great library for UI development in python. Specially the canvas widget of tkinter lets you make any custom widget for your application. If you are planning to create a piece of software or want to implement a GUI for your python scripts, then tkinter is still one of the best options out there. Moreover, after the arrival of [**`customtkinter`**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), it is super easy to create a modern user-friendly UI. The community is also growing and people are making new custom widgets for the library.


**Tkinter-Toolkit is a small application that helps you find new tkinter/customtkinter widget libraries created by some awesome people.** There are lots of libraries and widgets listed in this app.
