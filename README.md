Tkinter is a great library for UI development in python. Specially the canvas widget of tkinter lets you make any custom widget you want. If you are planning to create a new piece of software or want to implement a GUI for your python scripts, then tkinter is still one of the best options out there. Moreover, after the arrival of [**`customtkinter`**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), it is super easy to create a modern user-friendly UI. The community is also very kind and helpful. Also note that both customtkinter and tkinter libraries can be used together in one project.


**Tkinter-Toolkit is a small application that helps you find tkinter/customtkinter widget libraries and useful tools created by some awesome people.** There are lots of libraries listed in this application. So start exploring them one by one and develop great projects!

Note: This app is not a download manager for the libaries, it just shows the collection of those libraries which you can view and install manually. **All the official author names, repository links and description are written in the database. (_Any type of changes in the database is possible if required_)**

Hope it will help tkinter users and also the respected repository owners.
